generic_event.1.d: "After a long period of internal debates, political struggle, and growing public demand for reform, the time has come to decide the future structure of our nation.\n\nOur current governmental framework — whether authoritarian, monarchical, or otherwise rigid — is no longer sustainable. The people demand change, and history demands action.\n\nThe choice we make today will define the spirit of our governance for generations to come. Shall we establish a Parliamentary Republic, ensuring legislative supremacy? Perhaps a Semi-Presidential system, balancing executive and legislative power? Or place strong leadership at the heart of the state with a Presidential Republic?\n\nAlternatively, radical voices call for a return to monarchy — either a Semi-Constitutional Monarchy preserving royal prerogatives, or a fully Constitutional Monarchy where tradition meets modern democracy."

Will we embrace the harsh grip of fascist dictatorship, founded on a single leader with absolute power and the suppression of opposition? Perhaps we will follow a path of radical ultranationalism, prioritizing expansion and ethnic purity as the core of our nation's identity? Alternatively, a military dictatorship might take hold, placing our future in the hands of the armed forces, emphasizing strength and discipline?\n\nLastly, some advocate for a theocratic state, where religious authority governs all aspects of life, blending faith and law into an unbreakable bond that guides the nation's every action."

This is our moment of reckoning. The choice we make today will shape our nation for generations to come.\n\nShall we restore a glorious Absolute Monarchy, with a ruler above all? Or perhaps a Military Dictatorship, where the strength of the army governs our future? Alternatively, a Presidential Dictatorship, where the supreme leader holds absolute sway over both executive and legislative matters? For those seeking a return to faith as supreme authority, we could establish a Theocracy, with religious law as the foundation of governance.

As frustration mounts and discontent spreads, the time has come to consider a more decisive form of governance.\n\nThe question we now face is simple but monumental: How will we reshape our leadership? Should we turn to an Absolute Monarchy, where all power is concentrated in the hands of a single ruler, a sovereign whose word is law and whose authority is unquestioned? Or should we look toward a Military Dictatorship, where the nation's future is decided by the strength and discipline of the armed forces, prioritizing stability and order above all else? Another option, which promises centralized control without the military aspect, is to establish a Presidential Dictatorship, where a singular, powerful leader emerges to direct the nation with absolute authority, bypassing the slow and ineffective democratic processes. Each path offers its own vision of power, but the consequences of the choice we make today will define our future."

We must now define the very soul of our armed forces for the conflicts to come.\n\nThree paths lie before us:\n\nWe can place our faith in the resilience and sheer will of the common soldier, forming an army built around massed infantry and overwhelming artillery support. This would grant us unmatched defensive capability and the manpower to endure any hardship.\n\nAlternatively, we may embrace mechanization, forging a force of armored vehicles and infantry fighting machines that combine mobility, protection, and striking power. Such a force would dominate in maneuver warfare, allowing us to seize the initiative in battle.\n\nFinally, we might choose to build a mighty armored spearhead, centered around powerful tank divisions capable of shattering enemy lines with sheer force. Though costly, this path would make our army a juggernaut on the battlefield, unstoppable in its advance.\n\nOur choice will shape our military doctrine, our industry, and ultimately our fate. We must choose wisely, for the future of our nation depends on it."
generic_event.15.1.a: "Prepare for Strategic Decision"

generic_event.18.t: "Infantry Doctrine Chosen"
generic_event.18.d: "The path we have chosen leads us to the age-old backbone of any great army—infantry. In an era of mechanized warfare, it might seem backward to place our trust in the traditional soldier, but history has shown us time and again that well-disciplined foot soldiers, supported by powerful artillery, can hold the line when all else fails. With this approach, we embrace a force that values endurance, adaptability, and a deeply entrenched defensive stance.\n\nOur infantry divisions will be bolstered by the might of artillery—both in the form of powerful howitzers and advanced anti-tank guns. We will place our faith in a strong, unwavering line of defense, capable of withstanding the heaviest enemy bombardments and counterattacking when the time is right. Though slower and less mobile than their mechanized or armored counterparts, infantry and artillery form a balanced and highly effective force for holding territory and forcing the enemy into costly engagements.\n\nThis choice will allow us to build a massive, well-trained army that can endure through thick and thin. It will be a force that can engage in entrenched combat, where soldiers will fight for every inch of land. Our artillery will not only deliver devastating bombardments but also ensure that no enemy is able to break through our lines without suffering heavy losses. The battlefield will be ours to control—through sheer willpower, endurance, and heavy firepower.\n\nWhile this strategy might lack the mobility of mechanized or armored forces, it is designed to fight for the long haul. The army we create will be capable of resisting the tide of mechanized assaults, equipped to defend our homeland from invasion, and—should the time come—capable of striking back with overwhelming force. We will be ready to hold the line and turn the tide of battle through attrition and firepower."
generic_event.18.1.a: "Strength in Numbers"

generic_event.16.t: "Mechanized Doctrine Chosen"
generic_event.16.d: "In this new age of warfare, speed and flexibility are the keys to victory. We have chosen to embrace the mechanized force—an army built around infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and armored support. These machines will be our lifeblood, carrying our soldiers into battle with unparalleled speed and protection. In contrast to the ponderous tanks or traditional infantry, our forces will be a blend of agility, firepower, and versatility—ready to strike swiftly, adapt to any situation, and hold the line against any threat.\n\nMechanized infantry represents the perfect balance between power and speed. With IFVs, we combine the protection and mobility of armor with the firepower of advanced infantry units. Our troops will not be left vulnerable to enemy fire as they cross the battlefield—rather, they will ride in heavily armored vehicles capable of responding to threats quickly and decisively. These forces can rapidly respond to changing battle conditions, flanking enemies, reinforcing weak points, or launching counterattacks when needed.\n\nThis choice places a heavy emphasis on the mobility of our troops. We will create a force that can move across the battlefield as one cohesive unit, quickly redeployed where the need is greatest. The flexibility of mechanized forces will allow us to strike deep into enemy territory, encircle and cut off enemy formations, and maintain a constant pressure on our adversaries. While mechanized infantry may lack the raw, overwhelming firepower of tanks, they will be more than capable of exploiting weaknesses and outmaneuvering larger, slower units.\n\nWe will need to ensure that our industrial capacity can meet the demand for these highly complex machines, as well as ensure that our supply lines can keep up with the fast-moving pace of mechanized warfare. Our success will depend on the effective coordination of infantry, armor, and support units, creating a well-oiled machine that can adapt to any situation. The future of our army lies in its ability to adapt, strike fast, and overwhelm the enemy before they can react."
generic_event.16.1.a: "Speed and Power"

generic_event.17.t: "Armored Doctrine Chosen"
generic_event.17.d: "We have chosen the path of thunderous power, a path where steel and fire meet to break the enemy's will. The future of warfare lies not in the entrenched, slow-paced battles of old, but in the rapid, devastating blitzkrieg of armored tanks. Tanks are the spearheads of modern combat—indomitable, unstoppable, and capable of punching through enemy lines with brutal efficiency. By choosing this path, we embrace the promise of a new era of warfare.\n\nOur armored divisions will be the vanguard of our forces—towering giants of steel capable of crushing anything that stands in their way. Each tank, a moving fortress of destruction, will break through enemy defenses and lead our forces into enemy territory with devastating speed and firepower. With heavy tanks, we will dominate the battlefield, forcing our enemies into submission before they even have time to react.\n\nHowever, this path is not without its challenges. Tanks are costly to produce and maintain, and we must ensure that our infrastructure can support the massive industrial effort required to produce them in sufficient numbers. Our army will rely on precision, tactics, and overwhelming power—speed and surprise will be our allies, but we must also ensure that our logistics are up to the task of supporting such an ambitious force.\n\nThis strategy will create a mobile, mechanized army capable of striking fast and hard. Our tanks will lead the charge, supported by infantry and artillery in close coordination. We will cut through enemy lines, leaving them disoriented and broken in our wake. The ability to outmaneuver and overwhelm the enemy will be our greatest asset. With the power of tanks, we will rewrite the rules of war and show the world that we are a force to be reckoned with."
