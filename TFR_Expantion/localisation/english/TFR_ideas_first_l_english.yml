 ### GOVERNMENT NATIONAL IDEAS ###
 Government_Tourbulenc: "The Start of the Political Campaign"
 Government_Tourbulenc_desc: "As political divisions deepen and national tensions rise, the race to capture the soul of the nation has begun. Parties old and new emerge from the shadows, rallying the public, courting the disillusioned, and promising salvation—or revolution.  This is the beginning of a campaign that may define not just a government, but an era. The turbulence is only just beginning."

 Ultra_Right_Rally: "Marches of Fire and Fury"
 Ultra_Right_Rally_desc: "Extremist elements on the far-right have begun organizing across the country. Clad in symbols of order and tradition, they call for a return to “purity,” “discipline,” and “national strength.” Mass rallies erupt, displaying militarized unity and dangerous charisma.   What began as a whisper is now a roar—one that threatens to reshape society entirely."

 Racial_purity: "Blood and Soil"
 Racial_purity_desc: "The movement now casts aside pretense. Beneath its polished speeches lies a core belief in racial hierarchy and exclusion. The state begins enshrining these ideals—culturally, legally, and demographically. Minorities, migrants, and “undesirables” are vilified. Eugenics and ethnonationalism take hold. This is not nationalism. This is biopolitics."

 Autocrats_Rally: "Autocrats' Rally"
 Autocrats_Rally_desc: "A rising tide of authoritarian rhetoric brings together reactionary elements under one banner."

 Democrats_Rally: "Democrats Rally"

 Socialists_Rally: "Socialists Rally"
 Socialists_Rally_desc: "The fires of socialism are reigniting. Libertarian and authoritarian leftist movements surge forward, united by a common cause—but internal divisions and unrest simmer beneath the surface."

 Mobilized_masses: "The Engine of the Movement"
 Mobilized_masses_desc: "The party has achieved something its rivals only dream of—mass mobilization. Through propaganda, fear, loyalty, and spectacle, millions take to the streets, chanting in unison, obeying without hesitation. Youth leagues, paramilitaries, unions, and media all speak with one voice. The country is no longer watching the movement—it is living it."

 Doctrine_of_Purity: "A Nation Forged Anew"
 Doctrine_of_Purity_desc: "Purity is no longer a slogan—it is a state religion. The movement seeks to engineer not just a new society, but a new citizen: loyal, obedient, and ideologically clean. Education, culture, and identity are rewritten. What began as a fringe vision is now official policy. The nation is no longer plural—it is singular. The final transformation has begun."

 Fascist_Mobilization: "Steel in the Veins"
 Fascist_Mobilization_desc: "With clenched fists and marching boots, the nation embraces the call to arms. The state fans the flames of fear and pride, transforming industry into war engines and citizens into soldiers. Discipline replaces debate; duty eclipses dissent. The heartbeat of the nation now pulses with iron resolve."

 Paramilitary_Expansion: "Legions of the Loyal"
 Paramilitary_Expansion_desc: "Beyond the official army, a new force rises—uniformed, zealous, and answerable only to the party. Trained in shadows and bred for obedience, these paramilitaries blur the line between security and suppression. Their loyalty is not to law, but to the will of the regime."

 Cultural_Uniformity_Fascism: "The One True Culture"
 Cultural_Uniformity_Fascism_desc: "Diversity is declared division; difference is branded as danger. Art, language, and history are stripped of nuance and remade into tools of statecraft. Dissenting traditions are erased. A single, state-sanctioned identity is raised—and all must wear its mask."

 Doctrine_of_Glory: "March of the Immortals"
 Doctrine_of_Glory_desc: "War is not tragedy—it is transcendence. The doctrine of glory turns every battlefield into a cathedral, every sacrifice into sainthood. The army is no longer just a force—it is the vessel through which the nation writes its epic. Victory is divine. Defeat, unthinkable."

 Total_State_Control: "The Unseen Hand"
 Total_State_Control_desc: "Every transaction, every word, every breath is known. The state weaves itself into every thread of life—economic, social, and ideological. This is not governance. This is omnipresence. There is no outside. There is only order."

 Despotic_Shadow_Cabinet: "The Hidden Architects"
 Despotic_Shadow_Cabinet_desc: "Behind the podiums and titles, a cloaked circle guides the nation's fate. Unseen and unelected, they whisper commands that echo like law. Ministers are pawns, figureheads for a deeper will. Power lies not in public approval—but in secrecy and silence."

 Despotic_Intelligence_Expansion: "Eyes in the Walls"
 Despotic_Intelligence_Expansion_desc: "The regime casts a thousand eyes across the land. Surveillance becomes salvation, paranoia becomes policy. No whisper escapes, no room is safe. The enemy is everywhere—and everyone. In this state, to see all is to control all."

 Despotic_Internal_Control: "Chains of Harmony"
 Despotic_Internal_Control_desc: "Peace is maintained not through trust, but through total subjugation. Internal unrest is smothered under layers of coercion and propaganda.

 Despotic_Martial_Directive: "Rule by the Gun"
 Despotic_Martial_Directive_desc: "When parliaments falter, the military speaks. A new order emerges—efficient, unyielding, and armored. Laws are decrees; rights are privileges. Civilians obey, or they disappear. The state is not a council. It is a command."

 Despotic_Elite_Council: "The Iron Court"
 Despotic_Elite_Council_desc: "A cabal of warlords, tycoons, and ideologues now rules from polished chambers and fortified halls. They promise strength, prosperity, and continuity—but only for the loyal. Dissenters are exiled, rivals removed. The council is eternal. The people, interchangeable."

 Authoritarian_Democracy_Thought: "Order Through Representation"
 Authoritarian_Democracy_Thought_desc: "Democracy lives on—barely. Rebranded and tightly leashed, it becomes a tool of control rather than choice. Opposition is tolerated, but only in name. Elections occur, but outcomes are foregone. The people still vote. The state simply decides."

 Authoritarian_Civic_Activism: "The Guided Voice"
 Authoritarian_Civic_Activism_desc: "Activism is no longer grassroots—it is groomed. The regime cultivates civic action not to empower, but to channel. Youth movements, unions, and councils bloom under watchful eyes, their causes dictated from above. Passion is permitted—so long as it serves the state."

 Reconstruction_Authority: "Blueprints of Control"
 Reconstruction_Authority_desc: "As the dust settles from upheaval, a new infrastructure of power rises. Every brick laid, every plan approved, serves not just prosperity, but obedience. Roads lead to surveillance hubs. Factories hum with compliance. The future is rebuilt in the image of the regime."

 Volunteer_Engagement_Plan: "Brothers Beyond Borders"
 Volunteer_Engagement_Plan_desc: "The struggle does not stop at the nation’s edge. Volunteers pour forth, inspired by ideology and fueled by purpose. They fight not for pay, but for belief—spreading revolution, order, or salvation abroad. Where the flag cannot fly, their boots land."

 Administrative_Balance_Council: "The Engine Room of the State"
 Administrative_Balance_Council_desc: "Behind the spectacle of politics lies a chamber of pragmatists—technocrats, strategists, and cold calculators. They tune the gears of governance, ensuring efficiency over ideology. Not out of compassion, but necessity. Survival demands precision."

 Market_Supremacy: "Market Supremacy"

 Stateless_Capitalism: "Stateless Capitalism"
 Stateless_Capitalism_desc: "We have realized the dream of anarcho-capitalism. The state exists in name only. All functions have been outsourced, privatized, and absorbed into the market. Justice is competitive, infrastructure is efficient, and freedom is absolute."
